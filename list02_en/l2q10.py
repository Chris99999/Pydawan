Make an algorithm to read a number that validate a code which user input.
If this code is different from a code stored internally in the algorithm (example: 1234) the message 'Invalid user!' should be displayed. 
If the code is correct, read another value which is the password. If this password is incorrect (example: 9999) then the message 'incorrect password' should be displayed.
If the password is correct, the message 'Access allowed' should be displayed.
